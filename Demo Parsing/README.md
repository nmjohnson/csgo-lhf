# Demo Parsing

The main demo parsing script used here is available in this repo: https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/csgo

The scripts in this repo were just built out to help automate processing demos via the above script.

A good program to automate demo downloads is the Demo Downloader fro c9win: https://c9win.com/demo-downloader/
